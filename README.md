The output result is saved in a `.csv` file.

```

To use the command to select data in file:

```sh

  -i, --input FILE                Data file to convert  [required]
  -out, --output TEXT             name for the output files  [required]
  -f, --force                     Overwrite existing files
  -s, --file_sep TEXT             File separator (csv).
  -row, --nb_rows INTEGER         Number of rows to import from input_file.
  -keep, --columns_to_keep FILE   Path to file with columns to keep.
  -delete, --columns_to_delete FILE
                                  Path to file with columns to delete.
  -values, --values_to_keep FILE  Path to file with columns and data to keep.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.

### Specification for json parameter files

For the -keep and the `-delete` option, the template is given below :

```json
[
"<column#1>",
"<column#2>",
"<column#3>",
"<column#4>",
"<column#5>"
]
```

**column#x** are the columns you want to select/delete.
**Note that you can add as many columns as needed.**

For the `values` option, the template is given below :

```json
{  
  "<column#1>":["<value#1>", "<value#2"],    
  "<column#2>":["<value#1>", "<value#2", "<value#3", "<value#4"],  
  "<column#3>":["<value#1>"]   
}
```

**column#x** are the columns you want to select/delete.
**value** is a list of the values you want to keep on this column.
**Note that you can add as many columns as needed.**

### Build & run docker image (locally)

Build a local docker image using the following command line:

```sh
docker build -t data-selector .
```

Once built, you can run the container locally with the following command line:

```sh
docker run -ti --rm -v <your_path>:/DATA data-selector selector -i DATA/<path_to_data> -out DATA/<out_name> -s <file_sep> -keep DATA/<path_to_select_columns> -delete DATA/<path_to_delete_columns> -values DATA/<path_to_select_data_columns>
```

-v allows to mount a volume and to use your local data on the docker environment.

**your_path**: Local directory where the data (data to be selected, and parameter json files) are stored

**path_to_data**: The name of the file to select data from (in the Directory).

**out_name**: The name you want to give to the output file.

**file_sep**: File separator of the input file.

**path_to_select_columns**: Path towards json parametrization file.

**path_to_delete_columns**: Path towards json parametrization file.

**path_to_select_data_columns**: Path towards json parametrization file.

## Build

Project is built by [poetry](https://python-poetry.org).

```sh
poetry install
```

## Lint

```sh
poetry run flake8 --count --show-source --statistics
```

**Static type check** is performed by [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/).

```sh
poetry run mypy .
```

## Unit Test

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Be sure to write tests that succeed or else you'll be rejected by the CI.
